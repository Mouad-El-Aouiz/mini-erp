# Mini ERP

A multi-tenant SaaS for B2B computer hardware sales.

## Technology Choices

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Node.js

## Business Scope

- Business customers only.
- Currency: USD.
- Tax-exclusive catalog prices.
- Configurable demonstration tax rate: 10%.
- Complete delivery after order confirmation.
- Administrators and employees can confirm and deliver orders.
- Only administrators can cancel confirmed orders before delivery.
- Draft price changes require explicit acceptance before confirmation.

## Project Status

Application foundation implemented. Business modules, authentication and database integration are not implemented yet.

## Working Process

Each feature follows:
ticket → branch → implementation → verification → review → merge.

Project documentation, code and interface content use English.

## Design Documents

- [Business scope](docs/01-business-scope.md)
- [Data model](docs/02-data-model.md)

## Local Development

Use Node.js 22.23.2 and npm 10.9.8 to match the verified developer environment.
Docker Desktop and Compose will be used for the database in a later ticket.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Stop the development server with Ctrl+C.
The home page displays planned modules; it does not provide business operations yet.

## Quality Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Type checking generates Next.js route types before invoking TypeScript.
The build compiles the application; these checks do not replace business tests.
For a local production-mode check, run npm run start after a successful build.

Commit package.json and package-lock.json. Do not commit node_modules,
.next, next-env.d.ts or files containing secrets. The application uses system
fonts so its build does not require a Google Fonts download.

## Application Structure

- src/app/page.tsx: home page, rendered as a Server Component.
- src/app/layout.tsx: root HTML document, English language and metadata.
- src/app/globals.css: shared styles.
- src/app/page.module.css: styles scoped to the home page.
- tsconfig.json: strict TypeScript configuration and import aliases.
- eslint.config.mjs: Next.js and TypeScript lint rules.
